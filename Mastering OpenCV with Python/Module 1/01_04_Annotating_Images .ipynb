    "# 1. Read Grayscale Image as \"Color\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by reading and displaying an image that we wish to annotate. We selected a grayscale image for this example, but notice that we are using **`cv2.IMREAD_COLOR`** to read the image as a color image. Why is that? If we wish to annotate this image with color, then the image must support a color representation, even though the original image is a grayscale image. The image itself could be rendered as a single channel grayscale image or as a color image (with grayscale \"color\" values). In both cases, the displayed image will appear identical (as a pure grayscale image).\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand this let's consider the pixel intensity of a specific point in the gray sky. Let's assume the intensity value at [10,101] is 160. So if we read this image as a grayscale image (single channel) then the sky would have a pixel intensity of 160. If we read this image as a color image (three channels) then the pixel intensity at the same point would be represented as (160,160,160). The three channels have identical values and thus give rise to the same grayscale color as the single-channel representation. But singe the image data now contains three color channels it allows us to annotate this image with color!"
